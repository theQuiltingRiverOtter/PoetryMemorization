# PoetryMemorization
This project is a work in progress. 

Motivation: This application is intended to help users memorize poetry. Memorizing poetry is something I enjoy, but 
I have long wished for a way to better memorize longer poems. The end result of the application would have several sections.
One section would be a fill in the blank section, where the user will work on a stanza at a filling in missing words of 
increasing length. Another section would be a type-over section. The stanza would be displayed in the background and the user will type in the lines across the top.
